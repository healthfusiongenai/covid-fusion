# COVID-FUSION TODO.md

This is TODO.md to manage the project.

The initial goal is focused on ETL'ing the GSOD weather data into a database, and county geo data. This data will be used to create a simple model that looks a rate of changes in the weather data, and the rate of changes in the COVID-19 data.

## Todo

- [ ] protect project, enforce PRs, merges, and other git workflows (setup branch protection rules)
- [ ] add in exception handling
- [ ] add in unit tests, tox.ini
- [ ] parse csv file ino GsodData class
- [ ] create the cv_county_geo application, and/or python package. Goal: given lat/long, return the county name.
- [ ] Focus on Connecticut, counties, colllet sentiment, and other health data
- [ ] Fuse data to county and look for correlations
- [ ] Refactor the code to use go-lang, multithreading per file read, and other optimizations
- [ ] Fork off project for airflow POC, and kafka POC running on laptop
- [ ] managed dependencies, whl, and other dependencies (lots of them)

### In Progress

- [ ] 2024-12-10 debug running the docker containers

### Done âœ“

- [x] 2024-12-10 - Create a Makefile, and Dockerfile for the county geo data, and test it. Need external volume for the data.
- [x] 2024-12-08 - parsing gsod data writing to screen, need to parse into GsodData class, created a VERSION file for future image creation
- [x] 2021-04-11 - start to leverage D3 for visualizating county behavior, think about a risk model
- [x] 2020-04-11 - review what data is available in terms of COVID, understand formats, and access.
- [x] 2021-03-09 - create gsod python library, using text enums for dir names, update directory structure to separate out weather/gsod, instead of having one top level dir in: notebook, and datas
- [x] 2020-08-03 - research geographic information standards, start to choose what standard to follow, find access to data
- [x] 2020-06-23 - start to develop ETL capabilities
- [x] Create my first TODO.md
